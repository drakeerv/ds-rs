# ds: A library for controlling _FIRST_ Robotics Competition robots

`ds` provides the means to create an FRC driver station, allowing you to enable, and control robots without the use of the official, windows-only driver station. 

For a project written using this library, see [consoleds](https://github.com/Redrield/elm-ds)

This library requires building on a nightly compiler.
